### Abstract

Software (regression) testing is performed to de- tect errors as early as possible and guarantee that changes did not affect the system negatively. As test suites tend to grow over time, (re-)executing the entire suite becomes prohibitive. We propose an approach, RZoltar, addressing this issue: it encodes the relation between a test case and its testing requirements (code statements in this paper) in a so-called coverage matrix; maps this matrix into a set of constraints; and computes a collection of optimal minimal sets (maintaining the same coverage as the original suite) by leveraging a fast constraint solver. We show that RZoltar efficiently (0.95 seconds on average) finds a collection of test suites that significantly reduce the size (64.88% on average) maintaining the same fault detection (as initial test suite), while the well-known greedy approach needs 11.23 seconds on average to find just one solution.
